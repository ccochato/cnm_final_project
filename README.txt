FINAL PROJECT MONTE CARLO BOOTSTRAPPING

- AUTHOR: CARLOS COCHA

This project consists of two parts.
The first part is focused to compare the main differences between both, the weighted
and the unweighted linear regression fittings, using the Bootstraping method.

The second part is devoted to using the Bootstrapping Method to calculate the un-
certainties in the experimental calculation of the beam emittance of an electron beam with an
energy of 147.8 MeV.
